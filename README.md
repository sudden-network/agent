# Codex Worker: Feasibility + Design Notes

## Feasibility (short)

Yes. GitHub Actions can host Codex CLI runs, trigger them manually or from PR comments, persist sessions via artifacts, and reuse a single "worker" workflow across repos. See refs in this doc for the specific primitives.

## Core features -> how to implement

### 1) Manual start from GitHub mobile (issue-driven)

- **Need**: Trigger a run with an initial prompt.
- **Implement**: Create an issue with title + description as the prompt. A workflow on `issues` (created/edited) starts the run and uses the issue content as the initial prompt.
- **Refs**: GitHub Actions events docs.

### 2) PR comment-driven loop

- **Need**: Agent responds to PR comments and can be continued by replying.
- **Implement**: `issue_comment` trigger with `types: [created, edited]` and guard with `if: github.event.issue.pull_request` to ensure PR-only.
- **Refs**: `issue_comment` docs.

### 2b) Issue comment-driven loop (thread on issue)

- **Need**: Back-and-forth on the issue before a PR exists.
- **Implement**: Use `issue_comment` without the PR guard for issue threads. Restore the latest Codex state from the per-issue artifact and resume with `codex exec resume --last -` for follow-ups. Fail if no artifact exists.
- **Refs**: `issue_comment` docs.

### 3) Worker lives in separate repo

- **Need**: Reuse the same automation across multiple repos.
- **Implement**: Reusable workflow (`on: workflow_call`) in the worker repo. In target repos, call via `jobs.<id>.uses: owner/repo/.github/workflows/<file>@<ref>`.
- **Notes**: Called workflow inherits caller context; `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions can only be **downgraded** by the called workflow.
- **Refs**: Reusable workflow docs.

### 4) Persist Codex context between runs

- **Need**: Continue the agent session after a comment.
- **Implement**: Single-session-per-issue + per-issue artifacts:
  - Persist the full Codex state directory (`CODEX_HOME`) as the artifact, but strip `auth.json`.
  - On follow-ups, restore the artifact, then run `codex exec resume --last -` (stdin prompt).
  - Fail if no artifact exists on a follow-up comment (do not silently start a new session).
  - Overwrite the artifact on each run so only the current thread state is kept.
- **Refs**: Codex CLI features + Codex CLI reference + GitHub artifacts docs.

### 5) Secrets + auth for Codex

- **Need**: Secure auth in GitHub-hosted runners.
- **Implement**: Use org/environment secrets with `secrets: inherit` in the caller workflow so the worker can read `OPENAI_API_KEY` without per-repo wiring. Codex caches auth in `~/.codex/auth.json` (or OS keyring). Treat the file as sensitive. Device-code login exists for headless envs (`codex login --device-auth`). Optionally force file-based storage via `cli_auth_credentials_store` so auth can be carried in an artifact.
- **Refs**: Codex auth docs.

### 6) Concurrency + queuing

- **Need**: Controlled ordering with multiple runs possible.
- **Implement**: Use `concurrency` to limit parallelism per issue so `resume --last` is safe. Use per-issue artifacts so runs in different issues never share state. You still need a queue/drain strategy in the workflow logic.
- **Refs**: Concurrency docs.

### 7) Cancellation feedback

- **Need**: If a workflow is canceled, comment back on the PR.
- **Implement**: Add a step gated by `if: ${{ cancelled() }}` to post a cancellation comment.
- **Refs**: Workflow cancellation docs.

## Suggested architecture (minimal)

### Worker repo (single source of truth)

Reusable workflow with these phases:

1. Checkout target repo (using caller context).
2. Restore the per-thread session artifact (only that session).
3. Run Codex with the prompt and restored state:
   - initial: run `codex exec "<prompt>"`.
   - follow-up (issue thread): restore `CODEX_HOME` from the per-issue artifact, then run `codex exec resume --last -` with the comment as stdin.
   - follow-up (PR thread): same pattern but scoped to the PR thread artifact.
4. If code changes are requested, create the session branch and commit/push once after the run finishes (see Branch + PR naming below).
5. Post the agent response back on the issue (issue thread) or on the PR (PR thread).
6. Upload updated per-thread `~/.codex` bundle as an artifact.
7. When a PR is created from an issue, start a new thread + artifact for the PR; comments move to the PR.

### Target repo (thin wrappers)

- **Issue create**: `issues` workflow that calls the worker workflow with the issue title + body as the initial prompt.
- **Comment**: `issue_comment` workflow that routes issue comments vs PR comments.

## Queue options (two viable paths)

### Option A: Drain-in-one-run (simpler)

- Each run:
  1. Load the "last processed comment id" per issue/PR from state.
  2. Process all new issue or PR comments for that thread in order.
  3. Re-check once for new comments before exit.
- Works with `concurrency` to ensure one active run, avoids reliance on run ordering.

### Option B: Explicit queue file (more robust)

- A lightweight "enqueue" workflow appends comment payloads to a queue file artifact or a dedicated branch.
- A single "worker" workflow drains the queue sequentially under a fixed concurrency group.

## Feasibility notes / gotchas

- `issue_comment` fires for both issues and PRs; guard with `github.event.issue.pull_request`.
- For the issue-create flow, use `issues` events and ignore non-task issue types by label or title prefix.
- Ignore bot-authored comments to avoid workflow comment loops.
- Reusable workflow permissions are inherited from the caller; they cannot be elevated in the worker repo.
- Concurrency group ordering is not guaranteed; pending runs can be replaced.
- Artifact retention is configurable with `retention-days` but capped by org/repo policy.
- If using `resume --last`, enforce one active run per issue/PR thread via `concurrency`.
- Persist one artifact per thread; do not share artifact bundles across branches or prompts.
- Closing keywords in PR descriptions only auto-link/close issues when the PR targets the default branch.

## Suggested MVP plan

1. Build worker repo with one reusable workflow.
2. Add thin caller workflows in one target repo (issue-create + comment-driven).
3. Add artifact-based session persistence with `CODEX_HOME` restore + `resume --last`.
4. Add queue logic (Option A first, Option B later).

## Branch + PR naming

- **Branch name**: include the issue number + short kebab-case prompt summary.
- **Example**: `codex/issue-<issue-number>/<short-kebab-summary>`.
- **Behavior**: only create a branch when code changes are needed. Commit and push once after the run finishes. No session id is needed in the branch name.
- **PR**: create a PR at the end of the issue thread (non-draft), or only when explicitly requested. Include a closing keyword in the PR body, e.g. `Closes #<issue-number>`, so GitHub links and auto-closes the issue when merged.
- **Issue link**: optionally link the branch to the issue via the issue sidebar (Development) or by creating the branch from the issue so it appears under Development.

## Thread isolation

- **Definition**: a thread starts at the initial prompt and owns a single Codex session (implicit).
- **End condition**: the issue thread ends when a PR is created; the PR starts a new thread with its own session.
- **Artifact rule**: one artifact per thread; name it with the issue/PR number and restore only that artifact.
- **State rule**: bundle the full `CODEX_HOME` (minus `auth.json`) so `resume --last` can work.
- **Issue rule**: follow-ups require an existing artifact; otherwise fail to avoid silent new sessions.
- **PR rule**: when a PR is opened, start a new thread + artifact; comments move to the PR thread.

## Artifact cleanup

- **Policy**: rely on artifact `retention-days` to auto-expire per thread (simple, low maintenance).
- **Suggested**: set `retention-days: 7` on upload.
- **Behavior**: always upload with `overwrite: true` to replace the prior artifact for the thread and reset the retention window (no artifact history kept).
